Apple announced the iPhone 4 today, which includes video chat!  Of course, the video chat is only available over...wi-fi connections (you can just pretend that it's not a cellphone!).  Nonetheless, that didn't stop Apple's Senior VP of Industrial Design, Jonathan Ive, from proclaiming that the new feature would "change the way we communicate forever."
