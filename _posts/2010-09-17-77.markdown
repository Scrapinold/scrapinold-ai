When you drink a soda flavored with high-fructose corn syrup, you're witnessing your tax dollars at work!  (Domestic corn prices are subsidized via a ["farm bill"](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Farm_bill), some of the cost savings of which are passed on to you, the consumer.  So when you pay your taxes, think of what a good and noble cause you're supporting!
