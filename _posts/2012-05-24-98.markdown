So, AMC theaters was recently purchased by a Chinese firm!  (source: [http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/news/movies/la-fi-0522-ct-amc-wanda-react-20120522,0,111278.story](http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/news/movies/la-fi-0522-ct-amc-wanda-react-20120522,0,111278.story))  

While this comic of course represents the optimal result of that merger, somehow I suspect reality will be less dramatic.
