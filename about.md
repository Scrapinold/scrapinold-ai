The New Adventures of Scrapinold Dooington is a surrealist comic chronicling the crazy post-retirement adventures of the world-renowned detective Scrapinold, alongside with a strange cast of characters.

## History


  Long ago, we came to the conclusion that our undergraduate college's student newspaper would greatly benefit from the addition of a comic by us. We thus created a <a href="scrapinold1-orig.png">test issue</a>Â using <a href="http://grail.cs.washington.edu/pub/papers/comics.pdf">Microsoft Comic Chat</a>. In this text issue, we see the prototypical versions of both Scrapinold himself, 
  and the "Dude" guy (Prof. Cheese has no equivalent in Comic Chat). In the end however, we decided to just draw our own character and background artwork, resulting in the visual style you see today!
  
  The comic was printed in that school newspaper, running for a full year! Afterward, it continued as a webcomic, albeit one with a sporaidic update schedule. it continued as a webcomic.  Scrapinold has even been immortalized on the college's campus, in brick form:
